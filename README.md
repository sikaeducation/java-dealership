# Java Car Dealership

Create a Java application that manages the inventory for a used car dealership. A car has the following characteristics:

* Vehicle ID (eg. `101121`)
* Make and Model (eg. "Ford Explorer")
* Color (eg: "Red")
* Odometer reading (eg: `32775`)
* Price: (eg: `12250.00`)

Your application should do the following:

* Print details about all vehicles in the inventory
* Add a vehicle
* Tell you how many vehicles have been created
* Find vehicles by make and model
* Find all vehicles that fall within a price range
* Find all vehicles that match a color

## Requirements

* Complete all features
* Load the inventory with 6 starter vehicles when the app is launched
* Use multiple classes
* App should be in a custom package conventionally namespaced for [Sika Education](https://sikaeducation.com)
* Keep your source code in a `src` folder and your compiled code in a `bin` folder
